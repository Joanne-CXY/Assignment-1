    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      "Polyphia" comes from the word "Polyphony", meaning "music whose texture is defined by the interweaving of several melodic lines". Playing off this definition, as a band, we capitalize on musicianship and that, musically, each member of the band is a cornerstone of our sound. We stray from the idea of a one-dimensional, vocal-centered, or guitar-centered, or drum-centered group, and let each member of the band play an integral part in the overall product. As a people, all of us have a unique and personal identity that makes us dynamic and purposeful, and our band means to convey this quality within all of us through our music; never diminishing the potential of others and thriving in unity

      In September 2022, Polyphia released the single "Ego Death", the fourth from their latest album, Remember That You Will Die. The release was accompanied by a video, both of which feature guitar virtuoso Steve Vai. Remember That You Will Die was released on October 28, 2022, and includes guest appearances by Brasstracks, Snot, Chino Moreno and the aforementioned Vai. The band have announced a 15-date European tour to support it.In September 2022, Polyphia released the single "Ego Death", the fourth from their latest album, Remember That You Will Die.

    <h2>Style and influences</h2>
    <p>
      The band initially became popular on YouTube for making guitar covers of hit songs, and their debut EP “Inspire” showed that they were mostly influenced by pop music. They became more metal-oriented in their following songs, and were soon associated with the progressive metal sub-genre called Djent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after their second LP “Renaissance” that they were branded as a progressive rock band, while Polyphia then began mixing funk, hip-hop and EDM elements in their new songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band's fourth studio album, Remember That You Will Die, has continued in this vein, further exploring "trap percussion and hip hop stylings", as well as incorporating a variety of genres, such as bubblegum pop and bossa nova.
